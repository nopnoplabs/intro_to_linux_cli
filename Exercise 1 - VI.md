# Exercise 1 - VI

VI - pronounced vee-eye, is a text editor created in the 1970s, not unlike this author.

Vi starts in command mode. The positioning commands
operate only while vi is in command mode. You switch vi
to input mode by entering any one of several vi input commands. (See next section.) Once in input mode, any character you type is taken to be text and is added to the file. You
cannot execute any commands until you exit input mode.
To exit input mode, press the escape (Esc) key.
